<p class="drop-capy"><em>THE judgment that was given in the case
of Somerset and Knowles, so contrary

the general sense of the nation before, having

been raised, and which are at length so magnified
and enlarged as to become the object of
a Parliamentary Inquiry; it is imagined, that

which it was want to be surrounded; yet in
the course of their perusal it will, perhaps, be
found, that there are not wanting answers to

<h2 class="nobreak fs150 lsp4" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="drop-capy">THE first Edition of the following
Considerations on the Negroe Cause
was written with haste, and published in
a hurry. The hope of seeing some much
abler pen than mine engaged in the discussion
of so important a question, and yet
seemingly so little understood, withheld
me from the undertaking; till disappointment
made it the resolution of an hour,
and want of time the effect of a few days
attention only. It was evident that whatever
was to have been suggested on the
subject, ought to have been known antecedently
to the legal decision of the Case:
but led on by the expectation of the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
useful endeavours of others, already was
the Term, in which judgment was to be
given, treading closely on my heels, without
my having taken one single step in advance
of the design. Thus circumstanced,
such dispatch became necessary as could
not fail to produce errors, imputable both
to me and the printer. Whilst one part
of the pamphlet was printing, the other
was preparing for the press: but even
this expedition had not its desired effect.
The Judgment was beforehand with the
Publication: whereby the Considerations
themselves were deprived of their object,
and I, in some measure, foiled in my purpose.
Upon finding however that the
very grounds of my argument (to wit, the
opinions of the Lord Chancellors Hardwick
and Talbot) were the subjects of <em>due
attention</em> to the Court, and that the determination
rested on this particular Case <em>only</em>,
from circumstances of insufficiency arising
out of the return made to the writ of
Habeas Corpus, I was induced to suffer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
this performance to make its appearance
to the public eye, though, like Hamlet’s
Ghost, with all its imperfections on its
head.</p>

<p>But being now called upon for a second
Edition, I have carefully corrected the errors
of the first, so far as they were perceiveable
to me. I have considerably enlarged
the work itself. I have inserted several
notes, in some of which the principles
of the late published argument of Mr. Hargrave,
and the argument itself, as applied
to the merits of this question, are <em>shortly</em> examined,
though (with what is offered in the
text) it is to be presumed, <em>fully</em> refuted.</p>

<p>Supposing too, that the judgment of the
Court of King’s Bench in this case might
be no improper addition, I have, from the
most authentic copy I was able to procure,
inserted it here: taking the liberty at the
same time of making some few occasional
remarks upon it.</p>

<p>The following <em>is said</em> to be the substance
of Lord Mansfield’s speech in the case of
Somerset and Knowles: “We pay due attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
to the opinion of Sir Philip Yorke
and Mr. Talbot in the year 1729, by which
they <em>pledged</em> themselves to the British Planters
for the legal consequences of bringing
Negroe-slaves into this kingdom, or their
being baptized;” which opinion was repeated
and recognized by Lord Hardwick, sitting
as Chancellour, on the 19th of October 1749,
to the following effect: He said, “that Trover
would lay for a Negroe-slave: that a notion
prevailed, that if a slave came into England,
or became a Christian, he thereby became
emancipated; but there was no foundation
in law for such a notion: that when he and
Lord Talbot were Attorney and Solicitor
General, this notion of a slave becoming
free by being baptized prevailed so strongly,
that the Planters industriously prevented
their becoming Christians: upon which
their opinion was taken; <em>and upon their
best consideration they were both clearly of opinion</em>,
that a slave did not in the least alter
his situation or state towards his Master
or <em>Owner</em>, either by being christened, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
coming to England: that though the statute
of Charles II. had abolished Tenure so far,
that no man could be a <em>Villein regardant</em>; yet
if he would acknowledge <ins class="corr" id="tn-ix" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'himself a Vellein'">
himself a <em>Villein</em></ins> engrossed in any Court of Record, he knew
of no way by which he could be entitled to
his freedom, without the consent of his
Master. We feel the force of the inconveniences
and consequences that will follow
the decision of this question: yet all of us
are so clearly of one opinion upon the <em>only</em>
question before us, that we think we ought
to give judgment without adjourning the
matter to be argued before all the judges,
as usual in the Habeas Corpus, and as we
at first intimated an intention of doing in
this case. The only question then is, <em>Is
the Cause returned sufficient for the remanding
him? If not</em>, he must be discharged. The
Cause returned is, the <em>slave</em> absented himself
and departed from his master’s service,
and refused to return and serve him during
his stay in England; whereupon, by his
master’s orders, he was put on board the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
ship by force, and there detained in secure
custody, to be carried out of the kingdom
and sold. So high an act of dominion must
derive its authority, if any such it has,
from the law of the kingdom <em>where</em> executed.
A foreigner cannot be imprisoned
<em>here</em> on the authority of any law existing in
his own country. The power of a master
over his servant is different in all countries,
more or less limited or extensive; the exercise
of it therefore must always be regulated
by the laws of the place where exercised.
The state of slavery is of such a nature,
that it is incapable of being now introduced
by Courts of Justice upon mere reasoning,
or inferences from any principles
natural or political; it must take its rise
from positive law; the origin of it can in
no country or age be traced back to any
other source. Immemorial usage preserves
the memory of positive law long after all
traces of the occasion, reason, authority,
and time of its introduction, are lost; and in
a Case so odious as the condition of slaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
must be, taken strictly, the power claimed
by this return was never in use here: no
master ever was allowed here to take a
slave by force to be sold abroad because he
had deserted from his service, or for any
other reason whatever; we cannot say,
<em>the Cause set forth by this return</em> is allowed
or approved of by the laws of this
kingdom, and therefore the man must be
discharged.”</p>

<p>I must confess, I have been greatly puzzled
in endeavouring to reconcile this
judgment with this state of it, and with
my comprehension.</p>

<p>“We pay due attention to the opinion
of Sir Philip York and Mr. Talbot,” are
the words of the Noble Lord who delivered
the judgment of the Court; and yet the
judgment is, in operation and effect, directly
subversive of the opinion. Now I must
take for granted that this opinion would
not have been cited, especially in so affirmative
a manner, if it had had nothing at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
all to do with the Case then before the
Court: because such citation would have
been unmeaning and unnecessary. This
being admitted, it follows, that the law
laid down in this opinion was either the
law of the Case, or it was not. If it were
the law of the Case, the judgment would
have been governed by that law, and consequently
contrary to what it is. If it
were not the law of the Case, in order to
shew what the law is, and that the law and
the judgment might correspond with each
other, as cause and effect, it would seem,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex necessitate rei</i>, that the doctrine advanced
in this opinion should have been set aside by
the superior force of legal argumentation
and authority. But the reasoning upon the
judgment stands thus: In the Premises
this opinion is cited as authority; then,
without any middle term denying that
authority, the conclusion is, by the judgment,
that it is no authority at all. Under
these problematical circumstances the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
solution possible to me was, that there
might be two decisions intentionally contained
under one judgment: that is to say,
that the opinion of Sir Philip York and
Mr. Talbot, was the law upon the general
merits of the question; and that this judgment
of the Court was the law upon this
particular state of it. Thus for instance:
if the return made to the writ of Habeas
Corpus in this Case had denied the lawfulness
of the writ itself, and Mr. Steuart
had claimed Somerset upon the ground only
of being his commercial <em>property</em>; then
the opinion of Sir Philip York and Mr.
Talbot had operated as law and authority:
but as the return had admitted the right
of slavery, and Mr. Steuart had claimed
Somerset as his slave, there being no laws
of slavery now <em>in use</em> in this country, either
for Negroes, or for any other species of the
human being, the judgment of the court
was, <em>from the insufficiency of the Cause returned</em>,
the law of this Case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span></p>

<p>But no sooner had this reconciliation
taken place in my mind, than another
perplexity followed. In the recital of
the opinion recognized by Lord Hardwick,
sitting as Chancellour, it is made
to conclude thus: “that though the Statute
of Charles II. had abolished Tenure so
far that no man could be a <em>Villein regardant</em>,
yet if he would acknowledge himself a
Villein ingrossed in any Court of Record,
he knew of no way by which he could be
entitled to his freedom without the consent
of his Master.”</p>

<p>Now, by connecting this latter with the
former part of the opinion, in the manner
it is done, it appears, as if Lord Hardwick
meant to declare, that the state
or situation of Negroes towards their
masters or owners arose out of, and was
founded upon, the remains of the antient
laws of villenage in this country. That
Lord Hardwick might have said what is
here stated, in order to shew (by way of
illustration of the Case upon which he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
then arguing) that even an Englishman
might still become a slave in this country,
<em>if he pleased</em>, I cannot deny: but with
any intention to prove that the condition of
Negroes proceeded from, and was the same
with, the condition of villeins, is, I must
assert, either the mistake of the person
from whose notes this speech was taken, or
the intention of him to puzzle and perplex
the Case: for it is manifestly impossible that
the Court could have put so much self-contradiction
and ignorance of the law
in the mouth of so wise and so great
a lawyer. His Lordship says, “that
Trover will lie for a Negroe slave.”
Now, can any thing be more expressive of
the law and condition of Negroes than this
is? What the nature of an action of Trover
is, and what kind of property is required
in a plaintiff to maintain such an action,
every Tyro of the law must be acquainted
with. Would his Lordship have said,
that Trover would lie for a villein? Every
Tyro of the law knows that it would not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
But if a Negroe and a villein were governed
by the same laws, Trover would lie for a
villein. His Lordship’s own words therefore,
and not this combination of them,
are the best comment upon his meaning;
and he in me, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non tali auxilio eget</i>, &amp;c.
It is enough that I have given the clew;
the reader will unravel the rest himself.</p>

<p class="p4b">I have now only a short word or two
more to add, in address to the reader; relying,
from my own consciousness, upon his
candour, that whatever errors of the head
he may discover, he will impute nothing
that is wrong to the dictates of my heart.
It is not the want of humanity, it is not the
want of feeling, but the possession of both,
with the love of truth, that has given birth
to these Considerations. My motives have
been, to shew that America does not afford
that scene of barbarity, which misrepresentation
would have painted upon it: that
cruelties and distress are to be found in
much greater excess even in this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">elysium</i> of
liberty: that whatever is the state and condition
of Negroes, it is Great Britain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
not America that is responsible for it:
that this therefore is a British, and not an
American question; as well it might be,
since, if I may be allowed to reason chymically
upon the occasion, whatever property
America may have in its drugs, it is
Great Britain that receives the essential oyl
extracted from them. These have been
my views. I neither meant to condemn or
approve the state and condition of Negroes.
I have appealed to the law: if the traffic
made of them be as agreeable to right reason
as it is according to law, I am glad of
it; if it be not, let state necessities justify
state tricks. But I meant an apology for,
and not a panegyrick upon, myself.</p>

<p class="pad2 smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p class="drop-capy">BEING, both by birth and fortune,
connected with one of the Islands in
America, I was led, somewhat interestedly
as your Lordship may suppose, to attend
to the arguments that were lately offered
in the Court of King’s Bench, in the Case
of Somerset the Negroe <em>versus</em> Knowles and
others. It was a new case, said to be full
of concern to America; and it had engrossed
much of general expectation. My object
therefore was that of information: but,
without meaning to lessen the labours, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
depreciate the merits of the learned counsel
concerned therein, I must confess, that
the lights thrown on the case did by no
means appear to me as, on either side, decisive
of the point in question<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. It is true
that a vast and extensive variety of reading
was shewn and discovered: the profoundest
depths of learning and science were fathomed
and explored: lawgivers, philosophers,
civilians, from all historic existence,
were brought to light and examined: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
examples, definitions, and opinions, which
Moses, Aristotle, Justinian, Grotius, Pufendorff,
and the rest, had given of slavery,
were cited, explained, and enlarged upon:
the edicts and regulations of French, Spanish,
German, Flemish, and Dutch police
on this head were mentioned and produced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
But, my Lord, with all due deference
and submission, may I ask, how applicable
was this antiquated and foreign doctrine to
the case then under your Lordship’s contemplation?
The politics of Aristotle are
not the rules of the Court of King’s Bench;
<em>neither is Roman jurisprudence the law of
that court</em>. As a display of general knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
it had with me, as it must have had
with every one present, its great abundance
of merit and commendation; and I had
followed the learned gentlemen, with the
highest pleasure, in their travels and pursuits
abroad in search of matter of illustration,
if the case had been brought home
with them at last, and rested on its own
<em>native</em> ground and foundation. But herein,
my Lord, I found myself unsatisfied and
disappointed: for how the question remained
with your Lordship as a point of law for
the judgment of the Court, I own, I was
unable to comprehend, or to learn. It is
therefore, my Lord, that I now take the
liberty to offer the following Considerations
to your Lordship’s notice and observance;
trusting to the importance of the subject,
and to your wonted candour, for my apology
and pardon in the attempt.</p>

<p>I have read, my Lord, to distinguish,
and have been ever taught to know, that
the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of
King’s Bench is the great and first expounder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of the laws of this Realm; great and
first in dignity and in office; in your
Lordship’s person, great and first professedly
in capacity also. Of these laws then,
my Lord, I have apprehended that there
are but two kinds, however sub-divided
into sorts or species: the unwritten, or
common law, of which judicial decisions
are the evidence: or the written or statute
law, otherwise called acts of parliament.
Now, my Lord, so far as this case is referable
to either of these establishments, so
far it lies before the Court, and falls under
the cognizance of your Lordship. This is
the source of enquiry leading to your judgment
and determination; and all without
the circle of this, I conceive to be inapposite
and eccentric. The first question then,
that would seem to arise on this position, is,
What is the common law of the land respecting
the case in issue, <em>considered as a case
of slavery</em>? It was said, I remember, by one
of the counsel, that the present state of
slavery among Negroes was totally different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
from the ancient condition of villenage;
that it was a new species of slavery utterly unknown
to the common law of England.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In this opinion I readily coincide, and agree
with the learned gentleman. The next
question is, What do acts of parliament
say on this head? I believe it must be said
for them, that they are, <em>enactively</em>, if I
may be allowed the expression, silent. If
this be so, then the conclusion will operate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction of
your Lordship’s Court. If the case be unknown
to the common law, and acts of
parliament are silent thereupon, what basis
must your Lordship’s judgment take?
Where there is no law, there can be no
remedy. If the common law be defective,
it is the business of acts of parliament to
supply the defects: but until those defects
are supplied, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub judice lis est</i>, and the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
must remain undetermined. Your Lordship
may however tell me, that, where
positive law is wanting, whereupon to
ground the decisions of a Court, recourse
may be had to the maxims and principles
of law, to the spirit of the constitution.
The result of this, my Lord, at best, is but
matter of opinion; besides, cases founded
on the self-same principles will often have
very different determinations, according
to the difference of circumstances, and the
alteration or change of times. Thus, if it
had even been an original maxim of the
common law, that slavery was incompatible
with the frame and constitution of this
country, yet it does not therefore follow,
that occasions have not since arisen to combat
with this principle, and to justify particular
conclusions differing from these general
premises. For instance, my Lord,
the impressing of seamen, is an idea as
heterogeneous to the nature and essence of
this government, as slavery painted on the
blackest ground can be. It is slavery itself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
in its very definition; and what signifies
the name, says Hudibras, since the thing
is the same? But the indispensableness of
the measure has nevertheless (to continue
the metaphor) given colour to the practice,
and it is now seen in another light and
view. But to return: If your Lordship
should be of opinion, for opinion it must
be, if there is no positive law to ground
your judgment upon, that Negroes in this
country are free, I will place in opposition
to this, the opinions of the late Lord
Chancellour Hardwick, and his predecessor
the Lord Chancellour Talbot, to wit, that
Negroes in this country are not free. Your
Lordship perceives, that I take your opinion
upon supposition only; the other
opinions are well-known facts. To search
then for the grounds of your opinion,
without the certainty of its being so,
would be now premature and unnecessary:
but, knowing the opinions of these two
great oracles of the law, it is of necessity to
conclude, that they had the most sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
foundation for them, seeing that it is allowed
on every hand, that no opinion was
ever given in any case whatever with greater
solemnity, or more deliberation, than these
were. Now, my Lord, to investigate the
reasons of these opinions, is one way,
perhaps, to arrive at the truth: but to follow
men like these, in their researches, is a
procedure fitted only to abilities such as
your Lordship’s are. As conjecture however
is open to all, though positive knowledge
is but the gift of a few; I shall
therefore venture to suggest what might in
part have led the ideas of these great and
wise men to the conclusion which they have
drawn, namely, that Negroes in this country
do not become free. I have before
stated, my Lord, and have agreed with one
of the learned counsel, that the condition
of slavery among Negroes is unknown
to the common law of this land: that it is
a new species of slavery, which has arisen
within, and not beyond, the memory of
man, as is necessary to the descriptive quality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of this kind of law; and, therefore,
being not under the comprehension, it cannot
be within the absolute provision of it,
however reduceable thereto it may be made,
by analogy, implication, or construction.
I have said too, that acts of parliament are
silent on this head. I have repeated what
I had before stated and said, in order to
draw this inference: that although the
slavery of Negroes is unknown to the
common law of this country, and acts of
parliament are silent thereupon; yet <em>the
right</em> which Mr. Steuart claims in the
Negroe, Somerset, is <em>a right</em> given him by
act of parliament.</p>

<p>I must then apprize your Lordship, that
from this instant it is my intention to drop
the term Slavery, at least as a term in argument
with me. It is an odious word,
that engendered this law-suit, and now
feeds and supports it with the fuel of
heated passions and imaginations. Instead
therefore of such prejudiced and unpopular
ground, whereupon the case has hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
been made to stand, I shall take the liberty
to remove its situation, to change its
point of view, and to rest it on the land
of <em>commercial Property</em>; from whence, perhaps,
it will be seen, not only in a less offensive
light, but where also it may find a
foundation more solid and substantial for
its support.</p>

<p>It is matter of course, my Lord, to say,
that you are well acquainted with all the
acts of parliament relative to the royal
African company of England, from its
establishment by charter in the reign of
Charles the Second down to the present
time<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. Now, my Lord, the end of this
company was trade: the object of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
trade Negroes, as the preamble to the act
of the 23d of Geo. II. c. xxxi. thus expressly
declares: “Whereas the trade to
and from Africa is very advantageous to
Great Britain, and necessary for supplying
the plantations and colonies thereunto
belonging with a sufficient number
of Negroes, at reasonable rates, it is
therefore enacted, &amp;c. &amp;c.” Whatever
then, my Lord, is matter of trade,
your Lordship knows, must be matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
property. The idea of the one is necessarily
involved in the other. But, my
Lord, these acts have not been content with
this general construction: they have gone
farther, and have themselves set the mark
and stamp of property upon Negroes.
Whether, my Lord, the Legislature is justifiable
herein, or whether it has authority
by the laws of nature to do this, is not for
me to determine. It is, perhaps, a right,
like many other civil rights, established
by power, and maintained by force: but
this is matter of speculation for the speculative.
I here contend only, that the
fact is as I have stated it to be; and as it
will appear by the statute of the 25th of
Geo. II. c. xl. “which was made for the
application of a sum of money therein
mentioned, granted to his Majesty, for
making compensation and satisfaction to
the Royal African company of England,
for their charter, lands, forts, castles,
slaves, military stores, and all other their
effects whatsoever; and to <em>vest</em> the lands,
forts, castles, slaves, military stores, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
<em>all other their effects</em>, in the company of
merchants trading to Africa;” and
wherein it is enacted, that “the royal
African company of England, from and
after the tenth day of April one thousand
seven hundred and fifty-two, shall be,
and they are hereby, absolutely divested
of and from their said charter, lands,
forts, castles, and military stores, <em>canoe-men</em>,
<em>castle-slaves</em>, and all <em>other their estate,
property, and effects</em> whatsoever; and that
all and every the British forts, lands,
castles, settlements, and factories, on the
coast of Africa, beginning at Port Sally,
and extending from thence to the Cape of
Good Hope inclusive, which were granted
to the said company by the said charter,
or which have been since erected or purchased
by the said company; and all other
the regions, countries, dominions, territories,
continents, coasts, ports, bays,
rivers, and places, lying and being within
the aforesaid limits, and the islands near
adjoining to those coasts, and comprehended
within the limits described by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the said charter; and which now are, or
at any time heretofore have been, in the
possession of, or claimed by, the said
royal African company of England, together
with the cannon and other military
stores, <em>canoe-men</em>, <em>castle-slaves</em>, at and
belonging to the said forts, castles, settlements,
and factories, particularly mentioned
and set forth in the first schedule
to this act annexed (such stores as have
been made use of in the service of the
forts, and such <em>canoe-men and slaves</em> as
may have died since the taking of the
said survey, only excepted); and also all
contracts and agreements made by or for,
or on the behalf of, the said royal African
company, with any of the kings, princes,
or natives, of any of the countries or
places on the said coasts; and <em>all other
the property, estate, and effects</em> whatsoever,
of the said royal African company, shall,
from and after the said tenth day of April
one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two,
<em>be vested in</em>, and the same and every
of them are and is hereby <em>fully and absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
vested in the said corporation</em>, called
and known by the name of ‘The company
of merchants trading to Africa,’ and
their successors, freed and absolutely discharged
of and from all claims and demands
of the said royal African company
of England, and their creditors, and every
of them, and of all and every person or
persons claiming under them, or any or
either of them.”</p>

<p>Here, my Lord, the <em>legal nature</em> of Negroes,
if I may so speak, is fully established
and clearly ascertained, by act of parliament.
Your Lordship perceives, that they
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in hoc verbo</i> declared to be property, and
are vested as goods and chattels, and as other
effects are, in owners prescribed for them.
If it is observed, my Lord, that the term
Slave is made use of, and recognized by
this act of parliament; it is answered, not
relatively so, as to a state of slavery, but
descriptively only of such things as shall be
deemed the property and effects of this company.
The statute, my Lord, of the 5th
of His present Majesty, ch. xliv. enacts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
“that such parts of Africa as were ceded by
the last treaty of Paris, together with the
goods, slaves, and other effects thereunto
belonging, and which were, by a former
act, vested in the company of merchants
trading to Africa, shall now become the
property of the Crown;” so that the King,
as well as this corporation of merchants,
are, by the law of the land, possessed, and
are now the actual and rightful owners, of
a very considerable number of Negroes,
under the afore-mentioned description, of
canoe-men, castle-slaves, women, children,
carpenters, and other artificers, particularly
set forth in schedules annexed to the
afore-mentioned acts. It is also enacted,
“that the trade to Africa shall be free and
open to all His Majesty’s subjects, without
preference or distinction;” and it is
further provided, “that these acts shall
be taken and deemed as public acts, and
shall be judicially taken notice of as such
by all Judges, Justices, and other persons
whatsoever, without specially pleading the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
same.” Thus far, my Lord, do acts of
parliament extend in the confirmation and
establishment of this trade to Africa. I
shall now beg leave to cite one statute
more, in order unquestionably to prove
what the sense of the Legislature of this
country is, with respect to the state and
condition of Negroes. This statute, my
Lord, is the 5th of Geo. II. c. viith, wherein
(it being made for the more easy recovery
of debts in His Majesty’s plantations
and colonies in America) it is enacted “that,
from and after the twenty-ninth day of
September one thousand seven hundred
and thirty-two, the houses, lands, <em>Negroes</em>,
and other hereditaments and real
estates, situate or being within any of the
said plantations, belonging to any person
indebted, shall be liable to, and chargeable
with, all just debts, duties, and demands,
of what nature or kind soever
owing by any such person to His Majesty,
or any of his subjects, and shall
and may be assets for the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
thereof, in like manner as real estates are
by the law of England liable to the satisfaction
of debts due by bond or other
specialty, and shall be subject to the like
remedies, proceedings, and process, in
any court of law or equity, in any of the
said plantations respectively, for seizing,
extending, felling, or disposing, of any
such houses, lands, <em>Negroes</em>, and other
hereditaments, and real estates, towards
the satisfaction of such debts, duties, and
demands, in like manner as personal
estates in any of the said plantations respectively
are seized, extended, sold, or
disposed of, for the satisfaction of such
debts.”</p>

<p>Herein then, my Lord, is not to be
found even the trace of an idea of slavery
considered as such by Parliament, among
Negroes: but, on the contrary, what their
legal state and condition is, is conceived
and expressed in terms so plain and clear,
so explicit and precise, that the most sceptical
cannot doubt the meaning, nor the
most simple fail to understand it. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
are, as houses, lands, hereditaments, and
real estate, assets; and, in like manner as
personal estate, to be disposed of, for the
payment of debts due to the King and his
subjects.</p>

<p>Upon this state and exposition then,
my Lord, of these several statutes, it
would seem that I am well warranted,
by their authority, in my idea, that the
right which Mr. Steuart claims in the
Negroe Somerset, is a right given him
by act of parliament; and confirmed in
my proposition, that this is a case of property.</p>

<p>But, my Lord, in order fully to establish
this doctrine, it may perhaps be expected,
that I should not only shew what
the law is, but that I should prove also
what the law is not; and this must necessarily
lead me to reason somewhat more
closely on the subject.</p>

<p>I am aware it may be objected, my Lord,
that property in Negroes so vested, is a
property created in Africa for the use and
purpose of the colonies in America: from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
whence a question will be deduced, Whether
Negroes are property in England?</p>

<p>It appears, my Lord, that a trade is
opened, with the sanction, and now under
the protection of parliament, between the
subjects of Great Britain and the natives or
inhabitants of Africa. The medium of this
trade on the one hand are, manufactures,
goods, wares, and other merchandize:
on the other, captive Negroes, or slaves;
which, for these commodities, are given
in barter and exchange. It will be allowed,
I presume, my Lord, that these British
traders, or merchants, have an absolute
property in their merchandize; to truck
and to traffic with this merchandize is the
legal institution of the trade: it will be absurd
then to deny, that they have not an
equal interest in the thing received, as they
had in the thing given. To avoid this dilemma
then, the objection recurs; that, in
Africa they may have an interest, in America
they may have the same, in Europe
they have none: but assertion without
proof, is argument without weight. Where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
is the law that has drawn this line of distinction?
Is there any act of parliament,
or clause of an act of parliament, that has
fixed and described the zones or climates
wherein property in Negroes may be held,
or where it may not be held? Until I am
better informed, my Lord, I must take for
granted, that no such law exists; and if
no such law does exist, the manifest conclusion
is, that where property is once legally
vested, it must legally remain; until
altered or extinguished by some power co-equal
to that which gave it<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>But as it may perhaps be to the purpose,
my Lord, to try the force and effect
of these acts of trade referred to, I will,
with your Lordship’s indulgence, state a
case or two, whereby their operation in this
country might be felt and perceived.</p>

<p>Suppose, my Lord, that a fleet of merchant
ships belonging to the African company,
containing twenty thousand Negroes
on board (more or less, it is of no matter),
bound from Africa to America, should, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
strange, contrary, and adverse winds, be
driven and wrecked upon the coast of England;
that the ships were lost and destroyed,
but that the Negroes had been landed in
safety on this shore of freedom: would the
African company, my Lord, be justified
and entitled to re-ship these Negroes in
other vessels, to the end that they might be
conveyed to their destined ports in America?
Or, would the pure air of this country,
as has been insisted on, set them, with
caps of liberty on their heads, free and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
large; thereby robbing, for so I must call
it, these merchants of their property to the
amount of one million of money, at the
allowance, and on the moderate computation,
of fifty pounds price for each individual
Negroe? In this kingdom of commerce,
my Lord, where the rights of
merchants are so well distinguished, and
the laws of trade are so minutely known, I
should presume that the case would not admit
of a question. Of what use would
the charter of this company be to them, if
the laws protective of that charter should
be found inadequate and ineffectual to the
maintenance and security of their property?
But again: it has been observed, that
by the statute of the 5th of George III.
chap. xliv. a number of canoe-men,
and other Negroes, in Africa, were vested
in the Crown. Now, by canoe-men, I
suppose, my Lord, are meant, African
sailors. Suppose then, that one hundred,
for example, of these sailors should, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
some contrivance or other, find their way
into England; would the King, my Lord,
have authority to remand them to their
place of duty? or, would writs of Habeas
Corpus, in despite of this act of Parliament,
protect them here; thereby determining
the right of the Crown in them?
The case, my Lord, speaks and determines
for itself. Wherein then, my Lord, differs
the case of Mr. Steuart from these?
Their importance is greater, but the principle
throughout is the same. I believe it
is not denied that Mr. Steuart was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> purchaser of Somerset, in the legal
course of trade. I do not apprehend that
any evidence was offered to shew that he
had stolen him, or that he came by him
otherwise surreptitiously. If my memory
does not fail me, the property was proved,
by affidavit, before your Lordship; or it
was stated in the return made to the Writ
of Habeas Corpus; but in either way it is
of no concern, since the title-deeds are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
not now before the Court as <ins class="corr" id="tn-47" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the objects of of'">
the objects of</ins> Litigation<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Here then, my Lord, without farther
disquisition, I might venture to rest the
defence of Mr. Steuart, and therein the
law of the case itself. The reasoning,
perhaps, may be said to be new, and it is
opinion only of my own that supports the
doctrine: but, I trust, that, upon examination,
it will be found to be not therefore
the less conclusive. However, as I am upon
the subject, it may not be amiss that I
should pursue it somewhat farther; and, by
extending the chain of enquiry, strengthen
and enforce the arguments that have
been already offered and applied. It was
said, by one of the plaintiff’s counsel, that
municipal laws were binding only in the
state wherein they were made; that, as
soon as a member of that state was out of
it, they ceased to have their influence on
him; and the laws of nature of course
succeeded to him. As a general proposition,
my Lord, this might have had its
admission; but even as such, it is not without
its exception. I think I have the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
classical authority of the law to say otherwise.
For instance, allegiance, which is
the duty that every subject owes to the
sovereign, or sovereignty, of that particular
state to which he belongs, is a municipal
law; and yet, neither time, place, nor circumstance,
can alter, forfeit, or cancel, the
obligation. An Englishman (says Judge
Blackstone)<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, who removes to France
or to China, owes the same allegiance to
the King of England there as at home,
and twenty years hence as well as now.
But, my Lord, with regard to the particular
application of this proposition, when
the gentleman endeavoured to make a distinction
between the laws of the colonies
and the laws of England, in my apprehension
he was extremely mistaken. I fancy
the relationship and dependency of the
children colonies on their mother country
did not occur to his mind. The circumstance
of their having internal laws of their
own, by no means argues a difference in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
those laws, independent of the laws of
England. As well might it be said, that
the laws of England are not the laws of
the county of Kent, because by the custom
of gavelkind they differ from the general
laws in the disposition of Estates; and so
of Borough-English, and wherever in this
kingdom particular customs are to be found
or met with. For, my Lord, it is not only
a first and leading principle of legislation
in the colonies, arising out of their original
grants and charters, and enforced by the
royal instructions given to commanders in
chief there; but it is also enacted by the
statute of the 7th and 8th of William III.
ch. xxii. “that no law, usage, or custom,
shall be made or received in the plantations,
repugnant to the laws of England:” so that,
by these restrictions, the very <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leges loci</i>
(wherein, from situation, from climate, and
from other circumstances, one might naturally
suppose some difference) are forced
as much as may be to a conformity with
the constitution and laws of this country;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and to prevent even the accident of a contrary
occurrence, your Lordship knows,
that there is a counsellour appointed to the
board of trade here, whose especial business
it is, to examine all the colony acts, and
thereupon to make his report, if necessary,
previous to the royal confirmation of
them. If property, therefore, in Negroes,
was repugnant to the law of England,
it could not be the law of America:
for (besides the reasons already assigned) by
the same statute wherever this repugnancy
is, there the law is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> null and void.
But I will further endeavour to elucidate
this matter, by begging a question or two,
by way of case in point. Let it be admitted
then, that a colony of English had
embarked from hence, in order to establish
settlements for themselves in some one of
the late ceded islands in the West Indies,
and that they were arrived, it may be said,
in the island, <em>where English troops, trampling
on the laws of God and man, are
slaughtering even to extirpation a guiltless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
race of Caribs, the aborigines of the country.
I mean the island of St. Vincent, an island
under the tutelage of a Saint too</em>! And
suppose that, upon their arrival there, the
Legislature of that country had taken it
into their heads to pass an act similar to the
25th of Geo. II. ch. xl. already referred to,
thereby vesting these people as property, in
certain owners allotted to them: I should
be glad to know, my Lord, whether this
act could possibly have operated as a law,
and whether it was not, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo instanti</i>, upon
its being enacted, destitute and void of all
force, validity, and effect? Your Lordship’s
answer doubtless would be, that this
act must have been its own executioner,
that it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</i>. Why then, my
Lord, does not the principle directive of
this conclusion on the case of the colony of
English, determine likewise on the case of
the Negroes? If an act of an American
plantation making property of a colony of
English there, is nullified <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab initio</i> from its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
being enacted, why is not an act making
property of a colony of Africans susceptible
of the same nullity? The reason,
my Lord, is twofold: first, because in the
one act, such a law is not only repugnant
to, but absolutely subversive of, the laws
of England: secondly, because in the
other act, such a law is not only consistent
with, but founded on, the laws of
England: and this, my Lord, proves to
mathematical demonstration, that the colony
laws are not only in general dependant
on the laws of England, but, in particular
instances, owe their origin and source
to them: so that, as the refracted rays of
light, diverging from one point through
a prism, may be concentred in the same
focus; in like manner may these laws,
notwithstanding their number and variety,
be collected and disposed of in one
common system or digest, as parts of
the same whole. From what therefore
I have here suggested, my Lord, I mean
to conclude generally, that the right and
property, not only of Mr. Steuart in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Negroe Somerset, but of every subject of
Great Britain in his Negroe or Negroes,
either in the colonies or elsewhere, is a
right and property founded in him by the
law of this land; that the royal grants,
letters patent, and charters, for and of the
African trade and company, confirmed and
established by acts of Parliament, are the
foundation whereupon all the laws of the
colonies, respecting their Negroes, are
built; and that, without such sanction,
those laws could never have been made.
For, my Lord, it is evident that the colonies
could not have had power of themselves
to institute this trade to Africa; neither
have they the means to support it.
Without this trade then to Africa, no Negroes
could have been imported to them;
and if they had had no Negroes among
them, they had needed no laws appertaining
to Negroes<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>But, my Lord, it may be urged, that
although the laws of England may make
property of Negroes, they do not make
slaves of them. I should imagine that, although
an individual, I might answer individually
for every American subject of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the King, that they do not desire any
greater interest in their Negroes than that
of property. It is self-sufficient to answer
all their purposes, and to produce all that
great good which this nation experiences
therefrom. It is a supposition of inhumanity,
I hope, inapplicable to these people,
that they should wish to make slaves of
their Negroes, merely for the sake of slavery;
and if it should appear, that there is
no such law existing in America, as the
law of slavery, considered as such, I should
infer that the contrary presumption was
fittest to be entertained and received. The
law respecting Negroes there, my Lord, is
the law of property, consentaneous to the
law of England. By this law they are
made real estate, for the purpose of descent,
and goods and chattels <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad</i> the payment
of debts. This is the original and fundamental
law concerning Negroes. I do not
remember ever to have seen the word Slavery
made use of, in any law, of any colony,
in America. I admit that Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
are there termed slaves: but I will
tell your Lordship why. In the criminal
law, where they become necessarily the
objects of punishment, it is essential that
they should have some descriptive name
or title given to them. It is for this reason,
therefore, that they are there, and
there only so called. As they had been
already defined to be property, as Negroes,
it could not be said that, if property should
strike his master, property shall be punished;
but it is said, that if a slave should
strike his master, this slave shall be punished
accordingly. Now in the antient law
of England, my Lord, when slavery was
part of the constitution, your Lordship
knows, that not only the villein was described,
but the law of villenage or bondage
was also known and laid down. In
the laws of America, the slave is made
mention of, for the reason assigned; but
the law of slavery, however impliedly, is
no where expressly to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>But here, my Lord, I must beg
leave to make a short digression, intentionally
to wipe off an imputation, which
by one of the plaintiff’s counsel was
thrown on the owners and possessors of
Negroes in America. In the course of his
pleading, he took occasion to draw a horrid
and a frightful picture of the barbarity,
and cruelties, that were exercised on these
beings in the colonies; and concluded
with hoping, that such practices would for
ever remain forbidden to this country.
Your Lordship knows, that wherever order
is, there discipline must ensue. Like as
cause and effect, they are inseparable one
from the other. Now it is not to be presumed,
that an hundred thousand Negroes
are to be held in obedience to ten or fifteen
thousand owners (for this perhaps may be
found to be near the average) without some
means or methods, which, from their accidental
application, might so generally
operate on their fears, as to produce the
end required. It is so in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
navy; it is so in the army of every country
in the known world. A soldier would
not put himself in the front of a battle, to
run the risque of being shot through the
head, if he did not know that this would
be the certain consequence of his desertion.
The fear of the latter gives him
courage to engage in the former: or, how
otherwise could fifty officers, perhaps,
command a regiment of a thousand men?
But, my Lord, the design of this gentleman’s
groupe of figures, was to induce a
belief in the Court, that English feelings
were to revolt at American punishments.
As martial law is not the law of Westminster-hall,
it is likely that he has not studied
it: but, living in this country, I cannot
suppose him a stranger to the effects of it.
Who have not been eye-witnesses to the
hundreds of stripes that have been given to
soldiers on the parade of St. James’s? I
saw once, my Lord, two sailors [who were
perhaps impressed men too] under the
sentence of receiving five hundred lashes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
each, flogged on their naked backs along
the sides of thirty-four men of war, lying
at anchor in the harbour of Spithead.
Was such a punishment ever known to
have been inflicted on any Negroe in the
American plantations? No, my Lord: the
laws of every colony forbid it: but a
stronger law than these prevents it, the
law of self-interest. Negroes are the
riches of those who possess them. Land,
without their aid and assistance, in order
to cultivation, is useless, and of no value.
If their healths are impaired, their labour
is lost, and profit ceases. If their lives
are destroyed, their places must be supplied
with more difficulty, and at a much
greater expence, than is commonly supposed.
The good consequence of which,
my Lord, is, that the state of Negroes,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, in America, is preferable,
nay infinitely more desireable, than the
condition of the poorer sort of people residing
even in this boasted happy isle. I
will not say, my Lord, that this is a rule
without an exception. There are madmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
in all parts of the world, who, as such,
act diametrically opposite to their interest.
Such there are in America: but your Lordship
sees, that the observation is founded
on reason; and I can assure your Lordship,
that it is the effect of general experience.
But, my Lord, I cannot quit this
subject without making all due allowance
for the learned counsel’s zeal for his client,
and for the warmth of his youth, which
probably might have hurried him into this
ill-grounded and uncalled-for reproach. It
was ill-grounded, as, I hope, I have proved:
it was uncalled-for, because not necessary
to the question; and could no otherwise
have been applied or received, than as
mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumenta ad passiones</i>: which, however
admissable to the ears of a jury, to the
distinguishing eye of a court, never fail to
carry with them their own impropriety.
But in justice to the gentleman, in other
respects, I am called upon to say, that it
was with infinite pleasure I perceived those
rays of genius and abilities in him, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
promise to shine forth so conspicuously, to
the ornament of this country, and to the
honour of Barbadoes, his native island, in
America<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>I come now, my Lord, to say, that I
hope it will not be imputed to me as vanity,
that I have ventured to suggest what
might in part have led the ideas of those
great and wise men, the Lord Chancellours
Talbot and Hardwick, to the conclusion
which they have drawn, namely, that Negroes
in this country do not become free.
I was encouraged in the undertaking, by
the greatness of their authority. I was
enlightened in the pursuit, by the evidence
of their opinion. I thought myself justified
in resting their chief reasons and motives
on the principles of property; and I
will produce the opinion itself, as the warrant
of my justification:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are of opinion, That a slave, by
coming from the West Indies, either
with or without his master, to Great Britain
or Ireland, doth not become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
free; and that his master’s <em>property</em> or
<em>right</em> in him is not thereby determined
or varied; and baptism doth not bestow
freedom on him, nor make any alteration
in his temporal condition in these
kingdoms: We are also of opinion, that
the master may <em>legally</em> compel him to
return to the plantations<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="right smcap">
<span class="padr2">“P. York.</span><br />
“C. Talbot.”</p>

<p class="pad2 fs70">Jan. 24, 1729.</p>

<p class="p2">Upon this opinion, my Lord, I shall
make no other remark, than that right and
property seem to be the obvious ground and
foundation of it, or the hinges whereupon
the whole is made to hang and to turn.</p>

<p>But, my Lord, I will now admit, that,
what is held to be law, is at variance with
this opinion. It is laid down “that a
Slave or Negroe, the instant he lands in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
England, becomes a freeman;” that is,
“the law will protect him in the enjoyment
of his person and his property;
yet with regard to any right which the
master may have acquired to the perpetual
service of John or Thomas, this will
remain exactly in the same state as before.”
The interpreters of this law, my
Lord, may be <em>right</em> in point of <em>reason</em>;
but, I submit it, that they are <em>wrong</em> in
point of <em>law</em><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The case is this, my Lord:
seeing that Negroes are human creatures,
it would seemingly follow that they should
be allowed the privileges of their nature,
which, in this country particularly, are in
part the enjoyment of person and property.
Now, from hence a relation is inferred,
that has not the least colour of
existence in law. A Negroe is looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to be the servant of his master; but by
what authority is the relation of <em>servant</em>
and <em>master</em> created? Not by the authority
of the law, however it may be by the
evidence of reason. By the law, the relation
is, as <em>Negroe</em> and <em>Owner</em>: he is
made matter of trade; he is an article of
commerce, he is said to be property; he
is goods, chattels, and effects, vestable and
vested in his owner. This, my Lord, is
the law of England, however contradictory
to, or subversive of, the law of
reason<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Now as to the fact of property in Negroes,
without exception to this kingdom or limitation
to other countries, I am supported
in opinion by the authority of the learned
Judge Blackstone; though he ascribes the
rise of this property to a source very different
from me. In the chapter of, Title to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
things personal by occupancy, he says,
“As in the goods of the enemy, so also
in his person, a man may acquire a sort
of qualified property, by taking him a
prisoner in war, at least till his ransom
be paid. And this doctrine seems to have
been extended to Negroe servants, who
are purchased when captives, of the nations
with whom they are at war, and
continue therefore in some degree the
<em>property of their masters</em> (he should have
rather said <em>owners</em>) <em>who buy them</em>.” Here
then he refers to the law of nations, for
the establishment of that which I appeal
to the law of England for. Now, although
the law of nations might have been a good
ground to rest the municipal law of this
country upon, and might have served as a
preamble to, or reason for, an act of parliament;
yet it is not within my conception,
how, in such an internal concern as this is,
the law of nations could have been the law
itself. For example, if in the return to
the writ of Habeas Corpus in this case, it
had been set forth, that Negroe servants are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
purchased when captives of the nations
with whom they are at war, and therefore
the <em>law of nations</em> gives their masters a
property in their persons; would your
Lordship have thought this a <em>lawful</em> plea
for the remanding of Somerset? If not,
your Lordship finds that the fact of property
is admitted by the learned Judge,
without the proper foundation of law to
support it. But he proceeds to say,
“though, <em>accurately speaking</em>, that property
consists rather in the perpetual service,
than in the body or person of the captives.”
<em>Accurately speaking</em>, my Lord, I join issue
with the learned Judge: but, <em>legally speaking</em>,
the law is as he had stated it to be.
Those who speak accurately reason from
the real nature of Negroes, and draw their
conclusions from thence: the Lords Talbot
and Hardwick spoke legally, and drew
their opinions from the fountain-head of
law. Besides, my Lord, I conceive it to
be impossible that the law should be as
these interpreters or reporters have made
it to be; because the result of it is plain—inconsistency,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and positive absurdity. If
Somerset is protected by the law of England
in the enjoyment of his person and
property, how, in appeal to common sense,
can Mr. Steuart’s right in him remain
exactly in the same state as before? “Yes,
it may be said, he has a right to the perpetual
service of him; for this is no more
than the same state of subjection for life,
which every apprentice submits to for the
space of seven years, or sometimes for a
longer time.” But by what mode or method
does Mr. Steuart acquire this perpetual
right to his service? There is no indenture
of apprenticeship on the part of
Somerset to him: there is no written contract
of any sort or kind whatever, there is
no parole agreement between them, to enforce
this right of service. How is it to
be maintained then? If by the purchase of
him, property is the offspring of purchase;
and, as such, Mr. Steuart claims him. If
he is not his property, he has otherwise no
right in him, nor to his services, and,
again, if he is his property, who shall disseise
him thereof?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>As I began, my Lord, with making
a distinction between slavery and property,
and have persisted in their legal difference
relatively to the state and condition of
Negroes, some farther explanation on this
point may perhaps be looked for and required
of me. I am sensible it may objectively
be said, that in every kind of
slavery there is an included degree of property,
more or less limited or extended;
and that this kind of property therefore in
Negroes is but an accumulated degree of
slavery: so that the distinction I have
made is a distinction without a difference,
and a mere contentiousness about words.
But, although I admit the truth of this objection
in part, I must deny, in the whole,
its application to the principles of my argument.
Slavery, my Lord, is that state
of subjection, which mankind, by force or
otherwise, acquire <em>the one over the other</em>.
In every society therefore where this state of
subjection prevails, the object and subject
of those laws necessary for the regulation
thereof are, what? <em>are human nature itself</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Let it be considered then whether <em>human
nature</em> is either the object or subject of the
laws of England, respecting the state and
condition of Negroes. And here, my
Lord, I beg leave to assert, that the appeal I
have already made to those laws maintains
the contrary matter of fact, with the undeniable
proof of self-evidence. But it may
again be urged, that authority, however
respectable, is not the test of truth; and
therefore, says the disputant, shew me the
reason, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cur</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quare</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamobrem</i>,
of these laws. To which, in the language
and postulate of the Greek Philosopher,
I reply; that, as matter of fact is the
<ins class="corr" id="tn-70" title="Transcriber’s Note—could be replaced by ‘Δὸς ποῦ στῶ’ to avoid the unusual pi and stigma characters.">
Δὸς ϖοῦ ϛῶ</ins> of my argument, beyond this,
it is not incumbent on me to extend my
enquiries. And yet, my Lord, a research
of this nature being perhaps founded upon
no impertinent or unmeaning curiosity, the
suggestions even of fancy and imagination
may not be here undeserving your Lordship’s
attention; and as such the subject is,
in this view, of course not unworthy my
notice. It being then evidently the will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it is not to be presumed, till the contrary
appears, that it was the effect also of the
wisdom of parliament, that Negroes under
the law should not be considered as
<em>human beings</em>; and therefore I am led to
surmise that this determination of the Legislature
might have arisen from one or
the other of two motives or considerations:
the one <em>physical</em>, the other <em>political</em>. With
respect then to the physical motive, your
Lordship need not be told how much the
origin of Negroes, the cause of that remarkable
difference in complexion from
the rest of mankind, and the woolly covering
of their heads so similar to the fleece
of sheep, have puzzled and perplexed the
Naturalists of all countries for ages past.
It was a subject of the deepest reflection to
the great and learned Mr. Boyle; and what
could engage his divine abilities, without
satisfaction either to himself or others,
is likely to remain among those <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcana</i> of
nature that are not to be revealed to human
understanding. But, although these phænomena
in nature are not to be accounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
for, and therefore admit of no principle of
law inferible from them; yet their very
incomprehensibleness, when compared with
other circumstances more known and better
understood, may serve to this end, as so
many lesser weights in the scales of greater
probability. Now, my Lord, it is an
opinion <em>universally</em> received, that human
nature is <em>universally</em> the same: but I should
apprehend that this was a proportion rather
taken for granted, than admitted to be
proved: for although the proper study of
mankind is man, and therefore the universality
of such an opinion is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> evidence
of its truth; yet, it is to be observed,
that, of all other studies, the science of
man has been least of all cultivated and
improved. Man only, who examines all
Nature else, stands unexamined by himself.
If we look into the vegetable and mineral
kingdoms of this world, we shall perceive
a scrutiny made in them the most
nice, accurate, and comprehensive, we
shall find these grand divisions of nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
arranged in classes, orders, kinds, and
sorts: we shall contemplate systems morally
perfect. If we take a view of the
animal kingdom below ourselves, we shall
be witnesses there also of the same order,
regularity, and perfection. Why then is
human nature exempt from this disquisition
and arrangement? Are men afraid to
turn their eyes upon themselves, lest they
behold themselves in the mirror of truth?
Or is it pride, or vanity, that causes this
neglect? Yes, men would be angels, angels
would be gods, says Mr. Pope<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; and
yet man, as Dr. Lister observes<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, is as
very a quadruped as any animal on earth;
and whose actions are most of them resolvable
into instinct, notwithstanding the principles
which custom and education have
superinduced. Of other animals then, it
is well known, there are many <em>kinds</em>, each
kind having its proper <em>species</em> subordinate
thereto: but man is one kind of animal,
and yet, without distinction of species,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
<em>universally the same</em>. Does not this seem to
break in upon and unlink that great chain
of Heaven, which in due gradation joins
and unites the whole with all its parts?
May it not be more perfective of the system
to say, that human nature is a <em>class</em>, comprehending
an <em>order</em> of beings, of which
man is the <em>genus</em>, divided into distinct and
separate <em>species</em> of men? All other species
of the animal kingdom have their marks of
distinction: why should man be universally
indiscriminate one to the other?</p>

<p>The great Mr. Locke says<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, that reason
is supposed to make the characteristic
difference between man and beasts: but,
what is the characteristic that distinguishes
man from man? That there may and should
be such a distinction, I have already endeavoured
to shew; and I am apt to think
that this is a question not without its
answer. The learned Dr. Hutchinson<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
has demonstrated the existence of <em>a moral
sense</em> in, and peculiar to, human nature;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
which as it serves essentially to distinguish
man from beasts, and to raise him from
the tenth to the ten thousandth link of the
chain, so is it, in my humble apprehension,
an evident criterion of the specific difference
between man and man. Now Mr.
Locke, speaking of reason as that faculty
whereby man is distinguished from beasts,
says, that beasts have reason in common
with men; in which however he is to be
understood, that beasts possess the faculty,
and in some measure have the use, of reason;
but man’s superiority over beasts consists in
the power of exerting that faculty, and in
the compound ratio of its exertion. As
beasts therefore have the faculty of reason,
and it is the exertion in degree of that
faculty (particularly in obtaining abstract
ideas) that creates the great difference between
man and beasts: so by the same
parity of reasoning, the <em>moral sense</em> being a
faculty of the human mind common to all
men, the capacity of perceiving moral relations,
the power of exercising that faculty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and the compound ratio of its exercise,
is that which makes the grand difference
and distinction between man and man.
All nature, my Lord, which is the art of
God, is wisely fitted and adapted to that use
and purpose for which it was ordained;
and the same observation is to be made even
in the art of man. A flea is not less perfect
than an elephant because of its size:
neither is the cup that holds a pint less
compleat than the vessel that contains an
hundred gallons; when both are full, the
end for which both were designed is answered
and fulfilled. The use then to be
made of this doctrine, my Lord, is, that
as experience, observation, and experiment,
are the foundations upon which all speculative
philosophy is raised; so, from experience
and observation, I judge that the
truth of this hypothesis may be very clearly
proved and demonstrated. Now, in order
to this, it is necessary to have recourse to
the histories of nations: to read, to examine,
and compare them, one with the
other. To observe the moral improvements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
had by them, to remark the social virtues
that prevail; and this will bring me to the
accounts that have been given of Negroes
(for histories they have none of their own)
and consequently back to the subject of this
address to your Lordship. But, my Lord,
forbearing to trouble your Lordship with a
detail of these accounts, I shall, referring
them to your Lordship’s memory, content
myself with the bare mention of a few
facts only<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Guthrie, in his account of Africa
from the tropic of Cancer to the Cape of
Good Hope, says, “The history of this
continent is little known, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
affords no materials which deserve to render
it more so. We know from the antients,
who sailed a considerable way round
the coasts, that the inhabitants were in
<em>the same rude situation</em> near 2000 years ago
in which they are at present; that is,
they had <em>nothing of humanity</em> about them
<em>but the form</em>. This may either be accounted
for by supposing, that nature has placed
some insuperable barrier between the natives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of this division of Africa and the inhabitants
of Europe; or that the former,
being so long accustomed to a savage manner
of life, and degenerating from one age
to another, at length became altogether incapable
of making any progress in civility
or science. It is very <em>certain</em> that all the
attempts of the Europeans, particularly of
the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, have
been hitherto ineffectual for making the
least impression on these savage mortals, or
giving them the least inclination or even
idea of the European manner of life.”</p>

<p>All other writers on this subject agree in
these relations, or furnish others similar to
them: nor have I been able to find one author,
by whom I could discover that there
was any sort of plan or system of morality
conceived by these tribes of Africa, or
practised among them. Their barbarity to
their children debases their nature even below
that of brutes. Their cruelty to their
aged parents is of a kin to this. They
have a religion, it is true: but it is a religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
which seems the effect only of outward
impressions, and in which neither the head
nor the heart have any concern. They
have laws founded on principles, which
plainly prove the defective use of the <em>moral
sense</em>, as appears in this instance among
the rest. Their Judges are judges and
executioners at one and the same time.
When a criminal is condemned by them,
the Chief Justice first strikes him with a
club, and then all the rest of the Judges
fall upon him, and drub him to death;
and neither this, nor any other of their
customs, can time make any alteration
in, nor precept nor example amend. Indeed,
if it were otherwise, it would perhaps
be unnatural: for the Ethiopian cannot
change his skin, nor the Leopard his
spots. From this then, my Lord, I infer,
that the measure of these beings may be
as compleat, as that of any other race of
mortals; filling up that space in life beyond
the bounds of which they are not capable
of passing; differing from other men, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
in <em>kind</em>, but in <em>species</em>; and verifying that
unerring truth of Mr. Pope, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Order is Heaven’s first law; and this confest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some are, and must be, greater than the rest:”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The application of what has been said, is,
that the Legislature, perceiving the <em>corporeal</em>
as well as <em>intellectual</em> differences of Negroes
from other people, knowing the irreclaimable
savageness of their manners, and of
course supposing that they were an inferior
race of people, the conclusion was, to follow
the commercial genius of this country,
in enacting that they should be considered
and distinguished (as they are) as articles of
its trade and commerce only<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Thus, my Lord, borne on the wings of
Fancy, and led by Imagination’s wily train,
have I ventured in untrodden paths to
trespass on philosophic ground; to which
offence, however, pleading guilty at your
Lordship’s bar, I submit to the justice of
the sentence, be your Lordship’s judgment
whatever it may.</p>

<p>But having now discussed the <em>physical</em>
motive, which, as it is apprehended, might
have occasioned the <em>civil</em> existence, if I may
so say, of Negroes in this kingdom; the <em>political</em>
consideration proposed comes next in
the order of enquiry. It must be observed,
my Lord, that if the cause already assigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
be the real cause, whatever is to be advanced
on this head, is useless and superfluous.
Both causes cannot be true at one and the
same time. They are meant and must be
received in the alternative; or as the two
strings of Nimrod’s bow, of which if
either failed, the other supplied the want;
and of whom Mr. Pope thus speaks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bold Nimrod first the savage chace began,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A mighty Hunter, and his <em>game</em> was <em>man</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now the physical motive supposes a difference
of species among men, and an inferiority
of that species in Negroes: whereas
the political consideration, on the other
hand, infers an universal sameness in human
nature; that is to say, in fact, that
Englishmen are Negroes, and Negroes are
Englishmen, to all <em>natural</em> intents and purposes.
For what signifies the black skin,
and the flat nose, as the great Baron
Montesquieu would insinuate<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>? And yet
methinks, if the Baron had had a black
skin, and a flat nose, the world never would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
have had the benefit of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit des
Loix</i>. Upon this ground then, the question
that arises is, what could have given rise to
this degradation and debasement of human
nature? If these our fellow-creatures were
instruments necessary for the colonizing of
America, and to this end compulsory laws
were expedient also, why were these laws
not made suitable and suited to their nature?
Why were Negroes ordained a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mortuum
vadum</i>, instead of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivum vadum</i>,
(so to speak for comparison sake) to those
under whose dominion they came? Might
not the laws of villenage have been revived
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad</i> them? Might not other laws of
slavery have been enacted for their government?</p>

<p>Here is it then that policy, which is the
object of my discovery, must have intervened.
Now the planting of the colonies
opening with the 16th century, and consequently
commencing nearly with the
reign of James I. it appears, that during
the reigns of this race of kings, their cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and improvement were so rapidly
had, that, from a state of infancy, before
the end of the reign of Charles II. they
had grown up and increased to the vigour of
manhood. It is in this period of history,
therefore, my Lord, that I am to search
for, and to trace, the cause of this allotted
condition of Negroes: but, as it cannot
be expected that I should here enter into
the particulars of those times, so neither is
it necessary to my purpose. A single incontrovertible
observation will serve to rest the
whole of what I have to offer on this subject;
and which is this: that from the
<em>alpha</em> of the reign of James I. to the <em>omega</em>
of the reign of James II. <em>to enslave</em>, was
the fixed principle and uniform plan of government.
This then at once accounts for
the toleration of a measure, so inconsistent
with the principles of the constitution of
this country: but the reason upon which
the measure was grounded is not so immediately
obvious. From things that are
more known, things that are less known
must be deduced. Now it is a maxim in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
politics, that to obtain an end, direct means
are not always to be pursued, or rather
that <em>indirect</em> means are allowed to be practiced;
and this will lead me to mention two
questions that have been already stated.
Why were not the laws of villenage enforced?
or why were not other laws of
slavery enacted for the government of these
people? The answer is plain; these were
edged tools, which the complexion of the
times would not suffer the use of. Enough
was the plan of government exposed,
though hid under the cloak of religion.
Such a step would have left it naked, and
without a covering. Policy therefore
prevented that which the jealousy of the
people would have forbidden. In vain
would have been the argument, that these
laws were intended for operation in the
new world of America. <em>Ever to begin at
the extremes</em> is a well-known rule in the
art of attaining to despotism. The more
distant the design, the deeper laid is the
scheme, and the more sure in its consequences.
As in the body natural, even
so is it in the body politic. The disease<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
that lays hold of the toe, often finds its way
to the heart. Gradual encroachments by
imperceptible movements are the most dangerous
symptoms. They call off attention
to remedies, and lull suspicion to sleep.
But may all lovers of liberty ever have their
eyes open and awake to this despotic process!
He that would tyrannise in America
or abroad, awaits only the opportunity of
becoming a tyrant at Home; but thank
God, my Lord, the present times with us,
of all others, give least occasion for any
apprehensions of this sort. But to return.
Instead then of that Demon Slavery being
called in to preside over Negroes, Trade,
the guardian angel of England, was made
the ruler of them. This I attribute to
policy; which, however seemingly more
constitutional, was not less favourable to
the ruling principle of the Crown. I
have already admitted, that to erect corporations,
and to grant Letters Patent for
the purposes of trade, are in the Crown
its undoubted prerogative; but, considering
Negroes as human creatures, and
upon a level with ourselves, I submit it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
your Lordship, that the Crown had no right
to make slaves of them; whatever the uncontroulable
power of an act of parliament
might do: and yet Charles the Second, by
his Charter only to the Duke of York,
<em>enslaved</em> whole nations of these people.
The apology, I apprehend, for this, my
Lord, will be; that neither this Charter,
nor any other Grant, have ever conceived
Negroes in this light and view; as, relation
being thereunto had, will more fully appear<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.
If so, my Lord, two things come
out in proof: <em>presumptively</em>, that the
Crown had no right of itself to make
slaves of Negroes, or it would, in those
days at least, have exerted it; <em>positively</em>
by these authorities themselves, that Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
are not considered as slaves under the
idea of slavery, but merely as matter of
commercial property, and articles of the
trade of this country.</p>

<p>If now, my Lord, I have supported the
doctrine which I took upon me to evince,
and have satisfactorily shewn, that property
is the gift of action in this case, thereby
proving that Mr. Steuart may of course legally
compel Somerset to return to the
Plantations, I shall leave its decision to
your Lordship, on a quotation of your own
words: “It is not my business to alter the
law; or to make it, but to find the law.”</p>

<p>It remains then only to observe, that
if Somerset is the legal property of
Steuart, he, Somerset, cannot legally
be entitled to the writ which he has
sued out in aid of relief. The writ
of Habeas Corpus is a writ of right given
to the subjects of the Crown of England,
for the security of their liberties. If
Somerset can fall under this predicament
and description, he is open to the benefits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
that may arise therefrom; but if the law
has already fixed the <em>fiat</em> of property on
him, I apprehend it is a <em>legal</em> exception
to the writ, and his right is foreclosed
thereby.</p>

<p>Having said thus much, my Lord, on
one side of the question, I do not mean to
conceal my sentiments on the other. My
aim is, to establish the truth: my wish,
that what is right should be done. Whatever
then is here the result of my reflections,
to obtain the end I propose, is necessary
to your Lordship’s information.</p>

<p>When this matter, therefore, was first
in agitation, it stated itself thus generally
to my comprehension: that as it was a
case which existing for two centuries and
upwards, and never receiving finally any
judicial determination, it had better remain
in the situation it was. It compared
itself to me with some cases of royal prerogative,
and of parliamentary privilege,
which were excellent in theory, but subject
to inconvenience in practice; and whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
best and safest law was that of suspense:
but, my Lord, when I found that the case
was to be argued, and the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench taken thereupon,
my hopes were, that, if it was
possible to counteract the law of the land,
the decision would be in favour of the
Negroe: for although the knowledge of
their being free might spirit them up to
insurrections in America, yet it would put
a stop to their importation here by their
owners, and they would be more usefully
kept and employed in the colonies to which
they belonged. On the contrary determination
too, my Lord, it being solemnly
adjudged that Negroes in this country were
not free, I foresaw that this fatal consequence
might follow: that the trade from
Africa to America would be diverted from
Africa to England; and Negroes, in process
of time, would be sold in Smithfield
market, as horses and cattle now are.
Each farmer would have his Negroe to
drive his plough, each manufacturer his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
slave under his own controul; and America
that was conquered in Germany, as
was the saying of a very great man, would
become America ruined in England.</p>

<p>A great deal, my Lord, was urged by
the learned counsel, of the edicts of France,
relative to Negroes: but it does not occur
to my memory that this, among the rest,
was taken notice of. It may be, that I am
misinformed with respect to the fact; but
I will tell your Lordship how I came by
it. I have been myself, my Lord, a traveller
through every province of France,
and during my tour I never had opportunity
of seeing more than two Noirs (or
Blacks) as they are there called; one of
which was at Marseilles, the other at Bourdeaux,
the two chief ports of trade with
the American colonies of that kingdom.
Knowing therefore the intercourse with,
and observing the fewness of these people,
I was led to enquire into the reason of it;
when I was informed, that there was an
absolute edict of the present King of France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
prohibiting the importation of them into
that country, upon this political idea, that
otherwise the race of Frenchmen would,
in time to come, be changed. Greater
much, my Lord, is the reason in this
country to apprehend this event. It was in
representation, if not in proof, to your
Lordship, that there were already fifteen
thousand Negroes in England; and scarce
is there a street in London that does not
give many examples of that, which, with
much less reason, had alarmed the fears of
France. Upon the whole, then, my Lord,
let America and England look up to your
Lordship, as the man qualified to draw the
line of propriety between them. To this
end, let a Bill originate in the House of
Lords, under your Lordship’s formation:
let slavery, so far as property is such in
Negroes, be held in America: let the importation
of them be prohibited to this
country, with such other regulations and
provisions as your Lordship shall see fit to
lake place. Some centuries back, slavery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
was the law, and slaves the objects of that
law, as I observed before, in this kingdom:
but civilization has extinguished the
existence of both. When America shall be
what England is, some yet undiscovered
land will become what America is. In
short, my Lord, by this act you will preserve
the race of Britons from stain and
contamination; and you will rightly confine
a property to those colonies, upon
whose prosperity and welfare the independent
being of this country rests.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The late publication of Mr. Hargrave’s argument,
as one of Somerset’s counsel, gives me the
satisfaction of seeing in the whole, what I had before
the opportunity of hearing only in part. I confess I
know not which most to admire, the labour of this
Gentleman’s researches, or the ingenuity with which
his collected materials are systematized and disposed.
It is a history, perhaps the most compleat that is, of
the rise, progress, decline, and general state of Slavery;
and, whilst it does as much honour to his humanity
as to his understanding, will serve as a light to enlighten
the footsteps of posterity, should a revival of
the laws of Villenage be ever attempted in this country:
but, having said this, I must recur to my former
opinion, that, learned as his arguments are in general,
in this particular case they are founded on false and
mistaken principles, and are totally inapplicable to
the merits of the present question. His first principle
or point is, (vid. p. 12.) that “whatever Mr. Steuart’s
Right may be, it springs out of the condition of
slavery; and accordingly, says he, the return <em>fairly</em>
admits slavery to be the <em>sole</em> foundation of Mr.
Steuart’s Claim.” Thus, with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petitio Principii</i>, which
neither is, can, or will be admitted, and upon a manifest
error in the return made to the writ of Habeas
Corpus, does the argument of Mr. Hargrave commence,
rest, and depend. But if, instead of admitting,
there being no law to countenance such admission,
the return had relinquished the right, and denied the
claim, of slavery: if it had set forth, that Mr. Steuart
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> purchaser of Somerset in the legal
course of trade: that he had bought him out of a
ship’s cargoe from Africa, together with some elephants
teeth, wax, leather, and other commodities of that
country, for which he paid his money, or otherwise
gave in exchange the manufactures of this country:
that he had brought him here as an article of commerce
with his other goods, under the sanction of
the laws of trade: that he meant to export him hence
under the same protection, with his other property, in
order to be sold for his better advantage in one of the
English Colonies in America: that a writ of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habeas
Corpus</i> might as well issue on account of his elephants
teeth, his wax, his leather, and his other commodities
of that country, as on account of his Negroe, they being
expressly under the same predicament of law, and
so forth: I say, under such circumstances, and upon
such a return, what would have become of this stately
pile of elaborate argument?</p>

<p>High-built, like Babel’s tower, to magnify the fall!
Must not the lawyers have saught new ground to build
upon? Must not the Court have lost that error of insufficiency,
which now supports its only right of Judgment?</p>

<p><em>Note</em>, Although this argument of Mr. Hargrave is said
to have been delivered in the particular Case of Somerset
<em>a Negroe</em>, yet it is meant and intended as a course of
reasoning upon the general question of the state and
condition <em>of Negroes</em>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> It is said in Mr. Hargrave’s argument, p. 23.
“such was the expiring state of domestic slavery in
Europe at the commencement of the 16th century,
when the discovery of America and of the Western
and Eastern coasts of Africa, gave occasion to the introduction
of a new species of slavery.” If the arguer
had said <em>a new species of traffic</em>, instead of a new species
of slavery, he had expressed the real matter of
fact; seeing that the law by which this concern is
regulated, considers it in no other light or view whatever.
For this reason too, it cannot be enumerated
among the several species of slavery that he has mentioned,
and taken notice of; each distinct species having
its distinct laws, appropriated thereto distinctly,
as the laws of slavery. Among the Portuguese and
Spaniards, I have been given to understand, that Negroes
are, and have ever been considered, as with the
English, matter of Property, and articles of commerce
in the common course of traffic; and were so estimated
by the French, until the refined age of Lewis XIV.
gave rise to a new institution of law, under the title
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Code noir</i>, for the particular government of
Negroes in their American colonies. It were to be
wished that a fit and proper digest of this sort could
take place with us: but, I fear, the difficulty (which
arises not so much from the subject, as from the means
of introduction) will prevent the execution of any
such plan. From the unlimited power of the Crown
of France, when laws are made, it is easy to enforce
an obedience to them: from the limited power
of our monarchy, such obedience is not to be exacted.
Each English colony has a legislature of its own; and
although they all agree in the framing of laws not repugnant
to the laws of England, yet they all widely
differ among themselves in the mode and practice of
those laws.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> I have referred to this period of the Negroe-trade
to Africa, because Acts of Parliament go no farther
back in confirmation of it; but its commencement
was of much earlier date. It began in this country
about the middle of the 15th century, and was
carried on by means of letters patent obtained by
individual traders for their private emolument, until
the growth of the English plantations in America, in
the next century, made it an object of such importance,
as not only to render the establishment of a company
necessary, but of such profit as to engage even
crowned heads to be concerned therein. The first
charter was granted in the year 1661, in favour of the
Duke of York; but being revoked by consent of parties,
it was renewed in the year 1663, with more ample
privileges than the former. The principal adventurers
here, were Queen Catharine of Portugal, Mary Queen
of France, the Duke of York, Henrietta Maria Duchess
of Orleans, Prince Rupert, and others of the Court.
Thus upon the ground of an exclusive Right was this
trade continued, till, by the vast increase of the colonies,
it became, in the beginning of the present century,
a weight too heavy for the support of prerogative;
and so falling under the protection of Parliament, was
made, as it now is, a free, open, and <em>national</em> concern.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Mr. Hargrave says, in his argument, p. 67.
“Another objection will be, that there are English acts
of parliament, which give a sanction to the slavery of
Negroes; and therefore that it is now lawful, whatever
it might be antecedently to those statutes. The
statutes in favour of this objection are the 5th of
Geo. II. ch. 7, which makes Negroes in America
liable to all debts, simple contract as well as speciality,
and the statutes regulating the African trade, particularly
the 23d Geo. II. ch. 31, which in the preamble
recites that the trade to Africa is advantageous to Great
Britain, and necessary for supplying its colonies with
Negroes. But the utmost which can be said of these
statutes is, that they impliedly authorize the slavery of
Negroes in America; and it would be a strange thing
to say, that permitting slavery there, includes a permission
of slavery here. By an unhappy concurrence of
circumstances, the slavery of Negroes is thought to have
become necessary in America; and therefore in America
our Legislature has permitted the slavery of Negroes.
But the slavery of Negroes is unnecessary in England,
and therefore the Legislature has not extended the permission
of it to England; and not having done so, how
can this Court be warranted to make such an extension?”
Now this is the very assertion without proof that
I have complained of above, and have there fully answered:
but, in truth, the best answer it can receive, is
its own futility. Why did not Mr. Hargrave, instead
of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i>, produce authorities to set aside this
objection? He is on other occasions not sparing of
proofs and citations. But what is his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i>? It is
this:</p>

<p>The Legislature has permitted the slavery of Negroes
in America:</p>

<p>But the slavery of Negroes is unnecessary in England:</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ergo</i>, the Legislature has not extended the permission of
it to England.</p>

<p>This is his mode of reasoning, and these are his very
words, which, when examined syllogistically, shew, if I
have not forgotten my logic, that they are as little conformable
to rule, as to matter of fact. But, the fact is,
Mr. Hargrave has found this objection a stumbling block
in his way, and therefore, nimbly leaping over it himself,

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> With respect to the statute of the 5th of Geo. II.
c. 7. there are not wanting frequent instances of its
having been inforced in this country; particularly in a
case of the noted Rice: who, forging a Letter of Attorney
with intent to defraud the Bank of England of a
considerable sum of money, fled to France, was delivered
up by that Court, and afterwards hanged at Tyburn.
It seems, upon his absconding, a commission of Bankruptcy
was awarded against him; and the Commissioners,
as I am credibly informed, under this very Act of
Parliament here mentioned, sold a Negroe of his in the
city of London, as his property, and among his other
goods and chattels, for the satisfaction of the creditors.
But this act does not require cases for its confirmation,
neither is it the place where executed that I contend
for; it is <em>the vesting of the property</em>, without proviso or
condition, that surmounts all objection. Suppose I had
purchased a Negroe in the island of Barbadoes, or in any
other part of America, that had been extended there at
the suit of the King for a debt due to him, and had
brought this Negroe with me to England: would Mr.
Hargrave, or any other lawyer, say, that a writ of Habeas
Corpus, or any other writ whatsoever <em>not founded on
the verdict of a jury</em>, could dispossess me of a property,
which I held under the sense, letter, and spirit of an Act
of Parliament? Can any implication of law operate
against the express words and meaning of a law? And
would not such argument in its consequences be a mere
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Mr. Hargrave further says, in his argument, p.
67 and 68, “The slavery of Negroes being admitted
to be lawful <em>now</em> in America, however questionable its
<em>first</em> introduction there might be, it may be urged that
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex loci</i> ought to prevail, and that the master’s property
in the Negroe as a slave having had a lawful commencement
in America, cannot be justly varied by
bringing him into England.” This is one among other
objections raised by Mr. Hargrave in order to receive
his answer. Now as to the doubt expressed here, namely,
“however questionable its first introduction there
might be,” the right of granting letters patent, and of
erecting corporations for the purposes of trade, being
the undoubted prerogative of the king as arbiter of the
commerce of his dominions; the lawfulness of this trade
to Africa is no more to be questioned whilst it was
carried on under this direction, than it is to be questioned
now it is under the controul of parliament. It was
before constitutionally legal, it is now parliamentary
so: but the answer to the objection itself is as little satisfactory
as the doubt is. Here a most unnatural distinction
is aimed at between the colony laws in America,
and the laws of their mother country: putting the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex loci</i> of these colonies upon the same footing with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex loci</i> of Russia or Prussia, or any other foreign
country: whereas the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex loci</i> of the colonies is founded
on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex loci</i> of England, and is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in totidem verbis</i>, the
same, as has been made to appear.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> In looking into Mr. Hume’s Essays, particularly
the one of <em>national characters</em> (which I had never seen
till after the above argument was finished) I was made
happy to observe the ideas of so ingenious a writer corresponding
with my own: but as we differ in some respects,
and much of what I have suggested has been not
at all taken notice of by him, I shall beg leave to insert
here what he has said upon the subject. “There is,”
says he, “some reason to think, that all nations, which
live beyond the polar circles, or betwixt the tropics,
<em>are inferior to the rest of the species</em>, and are <em>utterly incapable</em>
of all the higher attainments of the human mind.”
Upon which he has the following note: “I am apt to
suspect the Negroes, and in general all the other <em>species</em>
of men (for there are four or five different <em>kinds</em>) to be
naturally inferior to the whites.” Now I do not apprehend,
that, in order to have different <em>species</em> of men, it is
at all necessary to have four or five different <em>kinds</em>. I infer,
that there is but <em>one genus</em> or <em>kind</em> of man (under the
term <em>mankind</em>) subordinate to which there are several
<em>sorts</em> or <em>species</em> of men, differing from each other upon
the principle that I have assigned; and, as Hudibras
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If one will do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What need of two?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides, it is seemingly a less systematical arrangement.
But he proceeds to say, “There never was a civilized
nation of any other complexion than white, nor even
any individual eminent either in action or speculation.
No ingenious manufactures amongst them, no arts, no
sciences. On the other hand, the most rude and barbarous
of the whites, such as the antient Germans, or
the present Tartars, have still something eminent about
them, in their valour, form of government, or some
other particular. Such a uniform and constant difference
could not happen, in so many countries and
ages, if nature had not made an <em>original distinction</em>
betwixt these <em>breeds</em> of men. Not to mention our
colonies, there are Negroe slaves dispersed all over
Europe, of which none ever discovered any symptoms
of ingenuity; though low people without education
will start up among us, and distinguish themselves in
every profession. In Jamaica indeed they talk of one
Negroe as a man of parts and learning; but, ’tis likely he
is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot
who speaks a few words plainly.” Thus Mr. Hume
marks the difference betwixt the several species of men,
by their natural capacity or incapacity of exerting in
degree the rational powers, or faculties of the understanding;
which is the distinction that Mr. Locke
makes between man and brutes. I distinguish man
from man by <em>the moral sense</em> or moral powers; and
although a Negroe is found, in Jamaica or elsewhere,
ever so sensible and acute; yet if he is incapable of
moral sensations, or perceives them only as beasts do
simple ideas, without the power of combination, in order
to use (which I verily believe to be the case) it is a
mark that distinguishes him from the man who feels and
is capable of these moral sensations, who knows their
application and the purposes of them, as sufficiently, as
the Negroe himself is distinguished from the highest
species of brutes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> There are two cases referred to in Mr. Hargrave’s
argument, (p. 52. and p. 54.) which are not only
fully explanatory of the above principles, but support
the opinion of the Lord Chancellours, Hardwick and
Talbot; and are in direct proof of the whole of my
argument. The cases I allude to, are those of Butts
and Penny, and Gelly against Cleve. The first was
an action of <em>Trover</em> for 10 Negroes; and there was a
special verdict, &amp;c. The Court held, that <em>Negroes being
usually bought and sold amongst Merchants, and being infidels</em>,
there might be a property in them sufficient to
maintain the action. In the second case, the Court is
said to have held, that <em>Trover</em> will lie for a Negroe
boy, because <em>Negroes are Heathens</em>; and therefore a
man may have property in them; and the Court without
averment will take notice, that they are <em>Heathens</em>.
Now upon two judicial determinations are the very
reasons of my argument held and alledged. <em>Negroes
are infidels</em>: <em>Negroes are Heathens</em>: of course unpossessed
of those religious and moral truths, which the Gospel
impresses upon all minds capable of receiving them;
and therefore the law, regarding the inferior state of
their nature, has considered them merely as <em>property
bought and sold among merchants</em>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
